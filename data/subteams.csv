0,Airframe,airframe,,One of two of the mechanical teams that focuses on the aerodynamic aspects of the plane.,"The Airframe subteam is responsible for all the aerodynamic components of the plane. The subteam designs, builds, and tests a custom airframe capable of carrying our mission payloads. Using rapid prototyping technology and composite materials, the Airframe subteam is able to create a robust and efficient airplane that excels at all required tasks.",/airframe.html
1,Autopilot,autopilot,,One of three software teams that handles the autonomous aspect of the plane,"The Autopilot subteam is responsible for ensuring that the aircraft can perform all necessary maneuvers to fulfill the mission requirements. This involves configuring and tuning the autopilot for each of our aircrafts, as well as implementing software to aid in autonomous flight planning, which includes our autopilot ground station and path planning algorithms. The Autopilot subteam is constantly evaluating all autopilot systems available to determine which will perform best for us.",/autopilot.html
2,Design and Operations,desops,,"(Previously known as Business) It dabbles into marketing, web development, pr, outreach, and more.","The Design and Operations subteam works at the intersection of technology, design, and business, similar to a start-up. Major projects of the subteam include the team's annual flight readiness review, technical journal paper, and website. The subteam primarily works on graphic and video design, front-end development, marketing and branding, sponsor relations, and outreach events.",/design-and-operations.html
3,Electrical,electrical,,Handles the electrical components of the aircraft.,"The Electrical Subteam handles the electrical hardware both in the aircraft and on the ground. The subteam works on the electronics firmware, avionics power distribution board, camera gimbal controller, airdrop controller, ground station antenna tracker, catapult launch controller, and communications system between the ground and the plane. The subteam is comprised of mainly dog people, with Ken as the sole hold out (smh). ",/electrical.html
4,Mechanical,mechanical,,One of two of the mechanical teams which has an emphasis of hardware and software integration.,"Mechanical focuses on designing for system integration and human interaction, through a closed loop design process that utilizes rapid prototyping technology and continual testing to design a world class UAV.  The mechanical subteam designs, builds, and tests the non-aerodynamic parts of the aircraft, such as the fuselage shell, camera gimbal, electronics bay, and airdrop mechanism, as well as various ground systems used for assistance during flight and subsystem testing, such as the antenna tracker and catapult.",/mechanical.html
5,Platform,platform,,One of three software teams that handles the server-side and infastructure of CUAir software .,"The Platform subteam designs and implements the software infrastructure that communicates between the plane's computer and the ground station. The ground server not only integrates data between the Autopilot and Vision subteams, but also uses a frontend to view mission-related information and images taken from the plane camera as well as to control various systems on the plane such as the camera, gimbal, and airdrop mechanisms.",/platform.html
6,Team Leads,leads,,Leaders of our team.,"The Full Team Leads are responsible for the entire interdisciplinary team of 50 students in which designs, builds, and tests an unmanned air system for a reconnaissance mission. The leads oversees the day-to-day operations of every subteam and delegates and assigns deadlines for each major aspect of the team. The leads also ensures that the team is prepared for the yearly international competition in Maryland.",/full-team-leads.html
7,Vision,vision,,One of three software teams which works on detection and identification.,"The Vision subteam is responsible for automatically detecting and identifying targets from images captured by our plane while it's in flight. This process involves target localization, shape classification, alphanumeric classification, color classification, and orientation. We use a frontend to test and view system results. We use a customized frontend to test our system. Our daily focus is to optimize system performance and accuracy.",/vision.html
