1,C. Thomas Avedisian,static/advisor-filler.png,"Dr. Avedisian joined Cornell in 1980 after receiving his doctorate. Prior to that he was employed at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J. in 1974 where he worked on thermal design of electronic systems. Dr. Avedisian has been a Guest Researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, Md.) since 1988 where he has pursued research on spray combustion and microboiling processes, and he was a Visiting Professor at Brown University in 1994/95. In 2008/2009 Dr. Avedisian was named a Science Fellow at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in Washington, DC by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At DOE he has assisted with program review and development for new energy technologies."
2,Rachit Agarwal,static/advisor-filler.png,"Rachit Agarwal is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. His research interests are in systems, especially for big data analytics, cloud computing and datacenter networks. He has also been known to dive deep into theoretical problems arising out of building practical systems. His research thus integrates systems, networks, and theory. Agarwal recently completed postdoctoral work at UC Berkeley, where he led the Succinct project. He completed his PhD at the University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign (UIUC) and was awarded the 2012 UIUC Rambus research award for outstanding performance in computer science and engineering research. He recently gave an invited talk at a workshop for distributed computing at the ACM Principles Of Distributed Computing 2016."
3,Bruce Land,static/advisor-filler.png,"Bruce Land is a Senior Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell. He teaches three courses revolving around microcontrollers, instrumentation and programmable logic. Land received a B.S. in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1968 and a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Cornell University in 1976. He was a Muscular Dystrophy Association postdoc in Neurobiology and Behavior (NBB) at Cornell for three years, then a lecturer in NBB for seven years. In 1987 he moved to the Cornell Theory Center as a computational research associate, then started supporting graphics and animation. He was scientific visualization project leader at the Theory Center from 1989 to 1998. From 1992 to 1998 he taught an introductory computer graphics course in Computer Science at Cornell. From 1998 to 2007 he taught computer programming and electronics courses in NBB."
